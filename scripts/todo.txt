need scripts to handle instrumenting several assemblies, including Assembly-CSharp.
Don't want everything instrumented there but interesting types/methods are
RuntimeAtlasPacker
RuntimeAtlasPage
ETGMod
ETGMod.Assets

e.g.  -it RuntimeAtlas -it "^ETGMod$" -it "^ETGMod/" Assembly-CSharp.dll

also need to handle instrumenting zips
